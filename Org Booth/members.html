        Hello everyone! My name is Jerbe Enorme, <br>

        I am 19 years and I live in Canlubang, Calamba City. <br>
        So why did I chose CpE? Ever since I was a child, <br>
        I always have a computer beside me and I use it almost everyday. <br>
         As I grew up, I’m intrigued how this kind of machine works and <br>
         can make trillions of operations. <br>
         I always envision that someday, <br>
        I can contribute something significant in this world that will benefit all people. <br>
